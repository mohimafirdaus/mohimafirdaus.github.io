<h1> <center>Nuffield Research Placement</center></h1>
<p> My four-week internship for the Nuffield research placement was carried out at the Imperial College London which is internationally known for its specialisation in science and technology. During these four weeks, I explored different methods of creating websites, such as using Google sites and using html, css and Javascript using a text editor. Google sites falls under the category of  specialist websites that are GUI-based, which allow users to select a background/layout from a set of pre-installed templates, type in text using the keyboard and insert pictures by importing them. This type of method does not require any code and is targeted towards those who are less familiar with coding.  However, if users wish to include code, they can use a HTML box where they can input their code. </p>

<p> HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript all work together. You need these three types of languages to create a website using code. </p>
