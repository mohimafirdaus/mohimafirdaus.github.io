<h1> <center>Nuffield Research Placement</center></h1>
<p> <center> </center>My four-week internship for the Nuffield research placement was carried out at the Imperial College London which is internationally known for its specialisation in science and technology. During these four weeks, I explored different methods of creating websites, such as using Google sites and using html, css and Javascript using a text editor. </center>  </p>
