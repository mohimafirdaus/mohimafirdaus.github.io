<h1> <center>Nuffield Research Project</center></h1>
<p> My four-week internship for the Nuffield research placement was carried out at the Imperial College London which is internationally known for its specialisation in science and technology. During these four weeks, I explored different methods of creating websites, such as using Google sites and using HTML, CSS and JavaScript using a text editor. Google sites falls under the category of  specialist websites that are GUI-based, which allow users to select a background/layout from a set of pre-installed templates, type in text using the keyboard and insert pictures by importing them. This type of method does not require any code and is targeted towards those who are less familiar with coding.  However, if users wish to include code, they can use a HTML box where they can input their code. </p>

<p> HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript all work together. You need these three types of languages to create a website using code. HTML is a mark-up language for describing web pages. HTML marks the content up into different structures, such as paragraphs, lists, images, tables, forms and comments. It should only be used for structuring the content. CSS is used to design the content. It tells the browser how the content should be displayed so it makes the content look more presentable to the audience. JavaScript is a scripting language which is used to make the HTML pages interactive for the user, so they can navigate around the website. It works by telling the browser how to change the web page in response to the user’s actions such as the click of a button. All these three languages make up a website and without one of them, the website would not function to the best of it’s’ ability.  </p>

<p>After, exploring the two methods of creating websites I had to decide on the method I wanted to use to create my own. For this, I decided to use GitHub which is a web-based Git repository hosting service which allows users to create their own websites by using code (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). I decided to use coding rather than a Google site because I found using coding more beneficial as it is much more challenging to make your own website from scratch than using a pre-designed template and this method would prove to be a fun learning experience to develop my passion for coding. I also found using code more flexible as with Google sites I was only allowed to add images or text in certain places on a page due to the use of pre-designed templates however with coding, I had full control and could design the layout of my page the way I wanted it. </p>
<p>During my time at the Imperial College London, I also participated in the ‘Women Hack For Non-Profits.’  This is an organisation where a group of women who are in tech get together once a month to meet, network, hack and write software for Non-profits. I was introduced to the ‘real-time humanitarian emergency planning using twitter’ project. This project aimed to develop an app where publicly available data from Twitter would be extracted and a statistical procedure would be developed to show representative patterns of population movements. This app would prove to be very beneficial, for instance it could be used by various organisations during humanitarian emergency to plan for natural disasters. For this project, I decided to develop a world map which would demonstrate the percentage of mobile usage out of 100 people. <a href="/method">Read more about how I created the map </a> </p>
