<p>My four-week internship for the Nuffield research placement was carried out at the Imperial College London which is internationally known for its specialisation in science and technology. During these four weeks, I was given the task of familiarising myself with different ways of creating websites so that I can help create a website using the method I found best, for a project being carried out by various academic and non-academic groups such as, ‘Women Hack For Non-Profits’ and the Imperial College London. The aim of this project is to have a website being developed in order to extract publicly available data from Twitter and a statistical methodology also being created to gather representative patterns of population movements. The website would then allow visualisation of movements of populations which would be used by various non-profit organisations targeting moving populations during humanitarian emergencies. One of the main purposes of creating a website is that, as there is a large amount of extracted data from Twitter, making data look appealing to the eye is necessary, so that it is easier to examine the richness of the available data. Kath O’Reilly from the Imperial College London is involved in this project, she is a research fellow based at the Medicine Faculty in the department of Infectious disease Epidemiology, who works closely with World Health Association and Unicef on the eradication of Polio. This project would prove to be of great use to such organisations as there would be many applications for such a website, such as it being used for site selection for vaccination teams. </p>
