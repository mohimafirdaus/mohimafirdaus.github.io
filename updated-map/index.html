<h1> <center> My updated map </center> </h1> 
<p> After creating the first map, I got constructive criticism from my collegues. They told me that although my map made it easier to visualise the information on mobile cellular subscriptions (per 100 people) worldwide, it needed certain improvements. They suggested that I change the colour of the markers from blue to another colour as it blended in with the map background and they also told me to insert a search box so it is easier to find locations on a map. After recieving feedback, I decided to create an improved version of the map so it can suit my end users better. I created this map using a map generator on Map Box by  providing the latitude, longitude and mobile usage for each of the countries.  </p>
