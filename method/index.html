<h1><center>My Method for creating the map</center></h1>
<p> To create the map, I first went onto Map Box and looked at the different maps that were available on the website. I then, found the map I liked and I copied the source code for the map and edited it to suit the requirements I had.   I edited the ‘L.marker’ part of the source code, this is the part that tells the code where to place the different countries on the map. To change the ‘L.marker’ bit, I first copied the data for mobile usage out of 100 people for the countries worldwide from the ‘World Bank’ website and then had to find out the longitude and the latitude for each of the countries. I placed this information on Microsoft Excel in a table and then from the table, I came up with the code and placed it in the source code.<a href="/map">Please feel free to have a look at the map I created  </a></p>
