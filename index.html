        		<h1>Hi there! My name is Mohima Firdaus.</h1>
				<p>In July/August 2015, I carried out  my 4-week internship at Imperial College London as part of the Nuffield Research Project. During this time, I learnt about the fundamental skills needed in order to create a website.  Please feel free to flick through this website to find out more about my experience at a new work-based environment. <a href="/about">Read more about my time in an internship</a></p>
