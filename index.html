        		<h1>Hi there! My name is Mohima Firdaus.</h1>
				<p>In July/August 2015, I participated in a 4-week internship at Imperial College London as part of the Nuffield Research Project. During these 4 weeks, I learnt how to create a website and an interactive map. This was certainly a wonderful experience and I took away with me a wide range of skills that I had learnt during this time. <a hretf="/about"> Read more about this experience</a></p>
